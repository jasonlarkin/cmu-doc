1) computer language vs human conversation

1) math equation -> executable code

Visulatization (PDF, etc)
->
math equation (Latex)
->
interpreted language (Matlab, Python, Spiral/SPL)
->
compiled language (C/C++, Fortran)
->
lower-level (assembly language 68HC11) https://www.clear.rice.edu/elec201/Book/6811_asm.html
-> 
executable code (binary)

1) exponential trends in technological advances

1) inefficiencies in rate constants: Moore's law period doubles, parallel computing
poor scalings of physical laws, efficient computation (paper on a laptop)

1) computational complexity and entropy: describing all bits in the universe versus

versus 
modeling just enough important ones

1) principle of computational equivalence:
